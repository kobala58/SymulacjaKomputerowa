# Coverage Problem in Computer Simulation classes.

## Description
TODO

## Inital assumptions
1. We are dealing with rectangular field of size in range from 20 to 200.
2. Field is represented as a Cartesian product of size x size.
 
## Code

On this project we decided to stick to Python. It enables fast development time with easy-to-use visualisation libraries. 
On the design side I decided to split everything into separate classes with on start might sound too complex, but in longer run create an efficient way to test many drones on many maps using different routes strategy without needs to repeat code over and over.
